This thesis documents the research conducted during an internship focused on AR Foundation, one of the current digital frameworks for augmented reality development.
The work was grounded in the exploration and comparison of different approaches to tracking three-dimensional objects. While one of the most common methods relies on the use of visual markers onto which augmented content is overlaid, this project instead concentrated on examining tracking performance in the absence of such markers.

Following the development of several prototypes designed to experiment with AR Foundation’s capabilities, the research progressed toward the design and implementation of an augmented guide for operating a coffee machine, which served as the primary case study for comparing the two main tracking approaches.

The objective of the project was to provide an efficient solution for augmenting industrial devices to support both operation and maintenance tasks.

The results highlight the differences between the two approaches in terms of lighting and color conditions, recognition speed, and the ability to maintain target focus. These findings are presented in the final chapter, along with overall conclusions and potential directions for future work.
